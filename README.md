## Overview

This was a practice exercise focused on writing CSS that styles a given HTML page to
match the look of a sample screenshot.

## Running

For best results, you can open this webpage in a local server that you can run
through VS Code's preview function. To use the preview function, the Live Preview extension
must be installed.
This webpage does not contain any scripts that need to be run, so it can also be viewed
by opening the raw index.html file in a browser window.

## Usage

None of the menu options are connected to other pages, but if you click on the birds in the
"Favorite Photos" section it takes you to a fullsize version of the picture and that's
pretty fun.
